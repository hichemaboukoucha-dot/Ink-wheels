# Ink-wheels
In this reinforcement learning-based game, an agent controls a cart that starts at point A on a straight road and must navigate to point B, where an ink reservoir awaits. Upon successfully reaching B, the cart exits the road laterally, dips into the ink, and begins drawing a parallel return path back toward the starting point A, effectively creating a new road segment. The agent's goal is to learn optimal navigation strategies—such as balancing speed, avoiding obstacles, or managing dynamics like friction or wind—through trial-and-error reinforcement learning, where rewards are given for progress toward B, successful ink collection, and completing the drawn return path without errors (e.g., veering off or running out of ink). Failures, like falling off the road or failing to reach B, result in penalties, encouraging the agent to refine its policy over episodes to consistently complete the loop from A to B and back via the self-drawn path.
